Some of the main types of CRM are     necessary for the documentation of several determinations such as     allergens, heavy metals and mycotoxins. Recent years we have expanded to     the production of Critical Laboratory Salts (QuEChERS) for the ideal     preparation of samples which makes pesticide residue analysis easier,     cheaper, faster and more reliable. Besides the Greek market the above     products have been settled through solid partnerships internationally to     more than 30 countries like, France, Germany, Switzerland, USA, Japan,     Spain, Italy, Canada, Malaysia, Great Britain, Poland, Finland, etc. </p> <table class='mytables'>     <tbody>         <tr>             <td width='312'>                 <p align='center'>                     <strong>CRMs</strong>                     (5-100ppm)                 </p>             </td>             <td width='312'>                 <p align='center'>                     <strong>QuEChERS</strong>                 </p>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td width='312' valign='top'>                 <p>                     Gluten, crustaceans, Peanuts, Soybeans, Lactose, Nuts,                     Eggs, Fish, celery, mustard, sesame, sulfites, Lupine,                     Mollusks                 </p>             </td>             <td width='312'>                 <p>                     FAL CMS 2, FAL CMS 2A, FAL CMS 2B                 </p>                 <p>                     MgSO4, PSA, NaCl, NaAcetate                 </p>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td width='312' valign='top'>                 <p>                     Mycotoxins (Aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, G2, M1  Ochratoxin A,                     DON, ZEA, Fumonisin, Patulin)                 </p>             </td>             <td width='312' valign='top'>                 <p>                     FAL CMS 3, FAL CMS 3A, FAL CMS 3B                 </p>                 <p>                     MgSO4, PSA, C18, GCB                 </p>             </td>         </tr>         <tr>             <td width='312' valign='top'>                 <p>                     Minerals (Ca, Mg, P, K, Fe, Mn, Se, Cu)                 </p>                 <p>                     Heavy Metals(Cd, Pb, As, Hg, Sn, Cr)                 </p>             </td>             <td width='312' valign='top'>                 <p>                     FAL CMS 4, FAL CMS 4A, FAL CMS 4B                 </p>                 <p>                     MgSO4, PSA, NaCl, C18, GCB, TCD, DHSQ                 </p>             </td>         </tr>     </tbody> </table> <br> <a href='pics/brochures/CRMs-QuEChERS Leaflet.pdf'> Information</a>",


	"SERVICES4_DESC":"<p>     One of the major risk factors in the food trade sector is their label.     Government agencies with a view to consumer protection have developed a     range of necessary information (marking requirements) that must be     displayed on the label. To further safeguard against any misleading     indications such information laid down by the legislation should be written     in a strictly specific way. Over the years these laws are adapted and / or     specialized in terms of the categories of food products.For this reason,     ensuring the accuracy of the displayed information in the primary packaging     of food products is not easy. Food Allergens Lab havingextremely qualified     personnel with vast experience in the field (more than 500 labels are     checked every year) is able to offer a legal review of the labeling of your     product, fast, easy, reliable and affordable. </p>",
